We call for your gracious support through giving, to meet with the huge budget required for this mission. Detailed mission report is found within the App under the feature titled; Primate Monthly. "Lift up your eyes, and look on the field, for they are white already to harvest..." May the Lord of harvest move our hearts unto going and groaning and move your hands unto giving in Jesus Christ Name.
